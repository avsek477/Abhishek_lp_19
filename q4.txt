As a PM for the startup of a company, considering all the pros and cons for a startup, I would suggest that building a website would be the best way to go. As for a broader outreach of marketing , a website would be a place to start. At a certain point, we need both a website and a mobile app, but it’s pretty safe to say that it rarely makes sense to build an app without already having a website in place.
The choice of building website over an app for a startup company can be identified as reasonable by the help of the following points.
1. Compatibilty: A website can be accessible to any mobile user(Android, iPhone, Windows) or a computer user. Whereas, development of mobile apps requires a separate version for each type of device.
2. Time and Cost: As a startup company, it is necessary for a PM to make economical decisions. As websites are easier and more time and cost-effective than the mobile app development, website would be a best way for a startup.
3. Support and Maintenance: Only the initial launch of a website or mobile app isnt enough, properly maintaining an app is much more expensive and involved than maintaining a website over time.
4. Easy to setup: Deployment of website doesnt need sumbitting apps to app stores, we just need  a domain and hosting.
5. Website linked to social media: As people nowadays mostly use social media such as Facebook, it would to easier to advertise the product as websites can be easily linked to facebook nowadays for advertisement.

Planning for the website, the following would be my priorities.

1. Highlighting the key factors that inhibits the job of the company.
2. Properly viewing the designs available within the company.
3. Proper information on the delivery system.
4. Constantly updating the features and services provided by the company.
