In order to examine a test login page, I would follow the following procedure:

1. First, I would perform a postive test case by signing in with a valid login in order to be sure of some of the expected functions of the login. Then, I would close the browser and reopen to see if I am still logged in or not.
2. Secondly, I would focus on the management of the session of the user i.e. is it through web sessions or via cookies.
3. Third, Sign in, then logout and then try to go back to the login page in order to ensure that the user is truly logged out or not.
4. Now, I would sign in from a browser, and then try to see if I can sign in again or not through another browser.
5. Lastly, I would change the password of the user and logout and then try to see if I can login with my old password or not.
